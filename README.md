# Rana üê∏

![Rana](rana.png)

Mine public keys that can be used with nostr.

This is based on [nip13](https://github.com/ok300/nostr-rs/blob/master/examples/nip13.rs) example.

Provide the desired difficulty or the vanity prefix as arguments. See below.

## Requirements:

0. You need Rust version 1.64 or higher to compile.

## Install

Using Cargo to install (requires ~/.cargo/bin to be in PATH)

```bash
$ cargo install rana
```

### Compile and execute it:

To compile on Ubuntu/Pop!\_OS/Debian, please install [cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), then run the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y cmake build-essential
```

Then clone the repo, build and run:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/grunch/rana.git
$ cd rana
$ cargo run --release
```

By default it will generate a public key with a difficulty of `10` but you can customize its difficulty or vanity prefix with the proper parameters.

Usage:

```
Options:
  -d, --difficulty <DIFFICULTY>
          Enter the number of starting bits that should be 0. [default: 10]
  -v, --vanity <VANITY_PREFIX>
          Enter the prefix your public key should have when expressed
          as hexadecimal.
  -n, --vanity-n <VANITY_NPUB_PREFIX>
          Enter the prefix your public key should have when expressed
          in npub format (Bech32 encoding). Specify multiple vanity
          targets as a comma-separated list.
  -c, --cores <NUM_CORES>
          Number of processor cores to use
  -q, --qr
          Print QR code of the private key
```

Examples:

```bash
$ cargo run --release -- --difficulty=20

$ cargo run --release -- --vanity=dead

$ cargo run --release -- --vanity-n=rana

$ cargo run --release -- --vanity-n=rana,h0dl,n0strfan
```

If you have it installed with `cargo install`:

```bash
$ rana --difficulty=20

$ rana --vanity=dead

$ rana --vanity-n=rana

$ rana --vanity-n=rana,h0dl,n0strfan
```

Keep in mind that you cannot specify a difficulty and a vanity prefix at the same time.
Also, the more requirements you have, the longer it will take to reach a satisfactory public key.

### Searching for multiple vanity targets at once

Specifying multiple `vanity-n` targets allows you to leverage the work you've already done to generate each new `npub` candidate. Searching a candidate `npub` for additional targets is incredibly fast because it's just a trivial string compare.

Statistically speaking, searching for `rana,h0dl` should take half the time that searching for `rana` and then doing a second, separate search for `hodl` would take.
